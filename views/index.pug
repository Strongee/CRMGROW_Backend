              | As the saying goes “It takes one to know one”, and while I’m proud to
              | say that at the time of writing this I’m within the top 3% of all eXp agents for
              | personal sponsored agent recruits, I wasn’t always so successful. It was a challenge to
              | recruit that many agents on my first level, so I know first-hand how hard it is to
              | recruit real estate agents and build your downline. However, through a lot of trial and
              | error, I learned what works and what doesn’t. I built my own proprietary tools and
              | systems until I found success, and that is how this platform, CRMgrow came about.
            p
              | Along the way, I spoke with countless eXp agents and I learned that
              | many of them simply don’t have the tools or knowledge to be successful at recruiting
              | agents. They would find it too challenging not knowing where to start and become
              | frustrated, often giving up on growing their revenue share team within a few months of
              | joining the brokerage. I wanted to fix that. With CRMgrow I've solved these problems by
              | combining all of the same tools and systems I’ve utilized into one easy-to-use
              | platform, built specifically for helping eXp agents like yourself see huge success.

              | I needed some sort of crm system for recruiting and
              | couldn't find anything. CRMgrow was an easier choice due to how easy it is to use and
              | the video screen tracking capabilities.

              | The last CRM I used was 4 times the amount of money
              | and didn't even have video tracking ability. Switching to CRMgrow has completely
              | transformed my agent attraction efforts.
